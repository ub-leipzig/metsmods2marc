It examines the family law reforms in India to understand the connection between legal reforms and                 social transformation.             bThe book explores a significant episode of Indian social history, the Hindu Code                 Bill controversy that stirred the Indian social consciousness in the mid-twentieth century. Revisiting                 the communicative processes surrounding the reform of Hindu customary laws relating to marriage,                 divorce, succession, adoption and maintenance, the book provides an in-depth account of the intense                 debate that took place in and outside the legislature involving political groups, social associations,                 religious organizations, legal associations, and the women's movement. Placing the debate in a                 historical continuum, the author tracess the genesis of the Hindu Code Bill by exploring the linkages of                 late eighteenth century initiatives of colonial administration, the efforts of eighteenth century social                 reformers, and the contribution of Indian national movement as well as women's organizations in early                 twentieth century. The book analyses the relationship of discourses in the public and legislative                 spheres and emphases the role of Nehru , Ambedkar, B.N. Rau and other prominent personalities in the                 promotion of gender justice. The book argues that while effective implementation of enabling legal                 provisions were impeded by deeply entrenched patriarchal structures in Independent India, the debate                 contributed towards a gradual transformation of the Indian social consciousness , thus contributing                 towards gender justice in Indian society. This book will interest scholars, researchers, and students of                 law, modern Indian history, and gender studies. It will also appeal to general readers.             0 aChitra Sinha is a PhD from the University of Mumbai and has been a Visiting Fellow,                 Centre for Study of Women, University of California at Los Angeles, USA.
